# Merchant Dashboard

## Features

- Translated in EN and FR
- List all the payments(transactions)
- View Payment(Payment) details and Installments by clicking on the payment row
- Payments Initially sorted by status
- Sortable columns (indicated by arrows in header)
- Filter payments by customer name and merchant name
- E2E tested for happy path and API failure

## Notes

- Entrypoint: `./src/index.tsx`
- E2E:
  - HappyPath tests file: `./cypress/integration/app.ts`
  - Execution: `yarn run cy:run`

## Decisions and Assumptions

- Scale of app didn't suggest for the use of store but can be easily integrated as payments and payment data is managed by hooks
- Payments are sorted by status by default in Alphabetical order; can be improved to sort by specific order like `[default, not_paid, in_progress, paid]`
- Navigation in app is very limited for these two pages only, high level UX can be improved
- Payment details page is not very well designed for now
- Sorting uses some generic types and uses `any` which IMO can be improved
- Unit tests are majorly handled by snapshots; and places where some details were necessary, more tests are added
- Index files are used as less as possible
- Initial code generated by CRA with typescript template
- CRA Customization for import aliases: [@craco/craco](https://www.npmjs.com/@craco/craco)
- I used `wouter` for routing because I wanted to try this library
- `ds` directory in code is for design system and is meant for very isolated and generic components which don't need any internal state
- `hooks` directory in code is for hooks and is meant for reusable business logic
- `utils` directory in code is for utility functions and is meant for reusable functions
- `api` directory in code is for API calls and is meant for reusable API calls
- `components` directory in code is for app specific components
- `pages` directory in code is for app pages
- `styles` directory in code is for app styles and tokens
- `locales` directory in code is for app locales

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
